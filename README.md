# 📚 DocuMind AI

> Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Intelligent Document Understanding

##  Overview

DocuMind AI is an experimental multimodal RAG system designed to understand and answer questions about PDF and Word documents. This project explores cutting-edge techniques in semantic chunking, cross-modal embeddings, and context-aware language generation.

## Key Features

-  Multimodal Document Processing - Extract text and images from PDFs and Word documents
-  Cross-modal Search - Query across text and images in a unified embedding space
-  Production-Ready Deployment - End-to-end deployment on Hugging Face Spaces
-  Real-time Q&A - Get intelligent answers from your documents instantly
-  Experimental Framework - Designed for rapid iteration and technique exploration

## Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

Live Link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sakshi0104/documind-ai
Status: Running (Free Tier - CPU)
Cold Start: ~5-10 minutes (CLIP model loading)
Warm State: 30 seconds per query

## 🔧 Configuration

Edit config.py to customize:

CHUNK_SIZE = 500              # Characters per chunk
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 50            # Overlap between chunks
TOP_K = 3                     # Number of chunks to retrieve
MAX_PAGES_PER_PDF = 5         # Pages to process per PDF
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "openai/clip-vit-base-patch32"
LLM_MODEL = "llama-3.1-8b-instant"
TEMPERATURE = 0.7
MAX_TOKENS = 1024

##  Performance

Cold Start: 5-10 min
Warm Query: ~30 sec
Embedding Time: 2-5 sec
Retrieval Speed: <100ms

##  Vision

DocuMind AI represents my exploration of modern AI techniques in document understanding and retrieval-augmented generation. Through systematic experimentation with different chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases, I aim to build a robust, adaptable system that demonstrates best practices in multimodal AI.

This project showcases end-to-end deployment from local development through production deployment on Hugging Face Spaces. As I continue this journey, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the open-source AI community and explore emerging techniques in semantic search, prompt engineering, and knowledge retrieval systems.
